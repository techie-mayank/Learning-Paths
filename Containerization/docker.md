# Docker Learning Path
## Beginner Level
### 1.1 Introduction to Docker
#### What is Docker?
- Containerization platform.
- Lightweight, portable, and efficient.
#### Docker vs. Virtual Machines
- Containers share the host OS, VMs have separate OS.
- Containers are faster and use fewer resources.
#### Key Benefits
- Consistency across environments.
- Faster deployment and scaling.

### 1.2 Core Concepts
#### Images
- Blueprint for containers.
- Built from Dockerfiles.
#### Containers
- Running instances of images.
- Isolated and lightweight.
#### Dockerfile
- Text file with instructions to build an image.
- Example: FROM, RUN, COPY, CMD.
#### Docker Hub
- Public registry for Docker images.
- Pull and push images.

### 1.3 Installation & Setup
#### Docker Desktop
- For Windows and macOS.
- Includes Docker Engine, CLI, and GUI.
#### Docker Engine
- For Linux systems.
- Core component for running containers.
#### Basic Docker Commands
- docker run: Start a container.
- docker build: Build an image from a Dockerfile.
- docker ps: List running containers.

## Intermediate Level
### 2.1 Working with Containers
#### Container Lifecycle
- Create, start, stop, and remove containers.
#### Port Mapping
- Expose container ports to the host.
- Example: docker run -p 8080:80.
#### Volume Mounting
- Persistent storage for containers.
- Example: docker run -v /host/path:/container/path.

### 2.2 Docker Compose
#### What is Docker Compose?
- Tool for defining and running multi-container apps.
- Uses YAML files (docker-compose.yml).
#### Key Features
- Service definitions, networks, and volumes.
- Example: Define a web app with a database.

### 2.3 Networking in Docker
#### Default Networks
- Bridge, host, and none.
- Bridge is the default for container communication.
#### Custom Networks
- Create isolated networks for containers.
- Example: docker network create my_network.

### 2.4 Docker Registries
#### Public Registries
- Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry.
#### Private Registries
- Host your own registry for proprietary images.
- Example: Docker Registry (open-source).

## Advanced Level
### 3.1 Docker Security
#### Best Practices
- Use minimal base images.
- Run as non-root user.
#### Image Scanning
- Tools like Clair, Trivy.
- Detect vulnerabilities in images.

### 3.2 Docker in CI/CD
#### Integration with Jenkins
- Automate build and deployment pipelines.
#### GitLab CI/CD
- Use Docker images for build and test environments.

### 3.3 Orchestration with Docker Swarm
#### What is Docker Swarm?
- Native clustering and orchestration tool.
- Simpler alternative to Kubernetes.
#### Key Features
- Service deployment, scaling, and rolling updates.

### 3.4 Advanced Dockerfile Techniques
#### Multi-Stage Builds
- Reduce image size by using multiple build stages.
#### Build Arguments
- Pass dynamic values during image build.

## Real-World Scenarios
### Microservices with Docker
- Decompose apps into smaller, independent services.
### Legacy App Containerization
- Modernize old apps by running them in containers.
### Troubleshooting
- Common issues: Port conflicts, volume permissions.

## Certifications & Resources
### Docker Certified Associate (DCA)
- Validate your Docker skills.
### Books
- "Docker Deep Dive" by Nigel Poulton.
- "The Docker Book" by James Turnbull.
### Labs
- Play with Docker: Hands-on Docker tutorials.
